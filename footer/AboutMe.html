		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<article>
		<p> My name is Ebonie Feurtado, I was born and raised in Mobile,Alabama.I got into Information Technologhy 
		after i suffered a very bad injury in track when I was in highschool. Computers were my escape and the only
		thing that brung me peace. I wanted to make this website because during that time of my life
		it was the hardest time for me mentally and physcially.This is something that i never liked to talk to people
		about because I grew up in a household that didn't like to talk about emotions or feelings.I wanted to make a
		website that not only can help someone but potentionally save someone life.</p>
